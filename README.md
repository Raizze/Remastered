# SWGEmu Core3

## What is SWGEmu?

Star Wars Galaxies was a massively multi-player online role playing game introduced by Sony Online Entertainment in the year 2003 and shut down in 2011.
It is this game the SWGEmu project focuses to recreate at a specific milestone referred to as Pre-CU, or Pre-Combat Upgrade. The Combat Upgrade was a set of game changes which radically changed the game-play, to the dislike of thousands of players. These changes led to the founding of this project, in an attempt to "recreate" the game as it was during the Pre-CU era.
At SWGEmu, Emulator refers to the software the SWGEmu team is building. This Emulator is meant to imitate Sony Online Entertainment's server-side software, which hosted the galaxies of Star Wars Galaxies during the Pre-CU era.

SWG Remastered

This server, like all other private servers, would not be possible without the incredible and selfless work of the SWGEMU Team. Their work makes up probably 85% of the code base used in running this server. We used the MTG Consoidated TRE files, as the foundation for creating SWG Remastered. We also make use of the LUA work contained in their repo. So MTG easily contributes the other 15% of work, that was used in creating SWG Remastered.

** We take no credit for creating much of anything on this server.

Core3 – SWG Emu Team
SWG Infinity – We used their /regrantskills command and we used some of their slicing code.
Cesta – We used his Galaxy Harvester Resource Generation Logic and take no credit for the work
TheTinyPebble - for always assisting with issues, ideas, or just letting me vent!
I've collected a large variety of paintings to use and the origination of some isn't very clear. Most came from the MTG tre set, but some may have came from the Tarkin tre set, but I'm not sure that is the place of orgination.

Many of our QOL Changes can be found on the EMU forums, under the forum post labeled Just For Fun 2.0.
Most all of our DECO, NGE Weapons, NGE Vehicles, NGE Components are directly from the MTG tre set. Full credit to that group. The Tarkin Repo does a good job of disributing that loot across the galaxy, so we used their loot group structures with minimal change. Credit to Tarkin for the loot groups.

I also want to thank my small group of dedicated supporters.  Your reddit posts, rush to explore our updates, and just overal encouragement around what we do...helps Remastered remain one of the most populated SWG Emu servers, to date.  Thank you All! I couldn't do this without your support!  (Current average 250-300 Accounts daily)
